I have been interested in programming since I was twelve years old. I originally started by learning the basics of C++ and have since learned many aspects of software development in general. It was only about two years ago when I realized that although programming has been a hobby of mine for many years, I could benefit from formal training and potentially move into a software development career.

To put it simply, I have always been fascinated by computers and I genuinely enjoy the creative process of programming.
