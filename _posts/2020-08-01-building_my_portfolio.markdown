Now that I am actively seeking a job, I've decided it's a good time to build my portfolio. Before I started this project, I thought that it would be fairly straight-forward, however, I'm spending much more time focusing on design and the aesthetic aspects of the project than I have previously.

While I feel very comfortable working with CSS at this point, I don't yet have a grasp on what it takes to design a site that comes across as professional. I've been taking time to look at various examples and other developer portfolios to get ideas. I'm using CSS animations for the first time, worrying about where I need to use pollyfills, and testing on multiple browsers; none of which, if I'm honest, were of much concern to me before this project. It's not that I was uninterested in incorporating these techniques in past designs, I just felt that it was much more important to have a project which functions well over one that looks good. Of course, It's always important that a site/program functions properly, although, when it comes to a portfolio, I believe that there's a greater balance between how much effort you should put toward functionality and design.

Font selection is another area of concern this time around. Prior to this point, I typically used the first couple of fonts I came across which fit the theme/look of my project, or used monospace. Now, I find myself trying out dozens of different fonts in an attempt to develop a cohesive, professional appearance.

In short, building my portfolio has been more of a learning experience than I had expected, and it's given me an opportunity to practice skills which I didn't spend much time with during my time at Flatiron.
