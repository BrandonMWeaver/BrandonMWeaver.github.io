HackerRank is a website which allows developers to practice everything from data structures and algorithms to language specific programming in languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, and even SQL and Regex. I'm really glad that Flatiron recommended this as a post-graduation activity, as some of these exercises are sure to not only help with the interview process, but also improve and solidify many of my skills as a developer.

I wish I had known about HackerRank sooner. I'm currently working through the problem solving exercises, and, although the earlier problems are not difficult, I quickly ran into problems which required me to do some serious thinking. I'm able to walk away after a few of these exercises, slightly more knowledgeable and prepared each time. The nice thing about these non-language specific exercises is that they allow you to tackle them in whatever language you choose; this way you don't have to worry about learning a new language to progress through them.

It is also possible to compete with other developers, earn certifications and badges, as well as search for job listings on HackerRank. While I haven't yet tried any of these activities myself, and I'm not sure how worthwhile the certifications are, it's nice to have such a rich variety of options to progress and stay sharp.

I would recommend developers of any skill set/experience level to create an account on HackerRank and give it a try. There are a few other sites/applications which provide similar content, however, in my opinion, HackerRank is one of the more thorough options available.
